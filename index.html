            <p><b>Music</b><br />
            I love singing Japanese songs, especially Ani-song and NICONICO originated song. If you like it, please checkout <a href="http://node.kg.qq.com/personal?uid=609f9485202a31823c&lang=zh_Hans">my channel</a>. I also play piano and trumpet, but I lost all my abilities since I have started working. <br /><br />
            <b>Anime</b><br />
            食戟のソーマ, No game No life and 四月は君の嘘 are my all-time favourite. I'm currently watching Overlord and Back Street girls. It sounds a little bit otaku but these are so so good and I like it a lot! <br /><br />
            <b>Books</b><br />
            I love reading chinese novels, especially those with fantasy and mysterious features. Some of my recommendations are: 修真聊天室, 修真四萬年, 獵國 and 龍族. Please contact me if you do have some nice and decent novel to recommend!
